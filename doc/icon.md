# Customize app icon
You can customize the icon that appears on the iPad home screen for your apps.
All of your apps will share the same custom icon. If you do not set a custom
icon, then a thumbnail of your app will be used instead.

* Open the appearance customization screen.

* Navigate to the site identity tab.
  
  <img alt="Site Identity" src="site-icon-2.png" width="240px" />

* Upload an image as the site icon. This will be the icon that appears
  on the iPad home screen when a web app is installed.
  
  <img alt="Site Icon" src="site-icon-3.png" width="240px" />
